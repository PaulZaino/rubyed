=begin

1. Try giving fewer than three arguments to your script. What values are used for the missing arguments?
Nothing? It seems like if just assigns it no value

2. Write a script that has fewer arguments and one that has more. Make sure you give the unpacked variables good names.

Combine gets.chomp() with ARGV to make a script that gets more input from a user.

=end
